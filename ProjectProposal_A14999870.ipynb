    "- As a customer, you have no way of knowing how closely a restaurant follows guidelines about temperature, cross-contamination, and basic sanitation. So, you rely on Yelp reviews and the restaurant's health inspection score. \n",
    "\n",
    "- An \"A\" grade tells you that the place is clean and is careful about food safety issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Restaurants are supposed to be inspected at least once a year. \n",
    "- The health department is not so strict that a restaurant might not go through a routine health code check for \"18 months to 2 years.\"\n",
    "https://table.skift.com/2018/07/24/yelp-adds-health-code-ratings-to-restaurant-pages-nationwide/\n",
    "\n",
    "- Restaurants can be stuck with a grade that is not necessarily reflective of the restaurant.\n",
    "- Yelp Reviews are more up-to-date (since they are updated almost everyday) and are reflection of people's experiences at the restaurant. Customers often write about the cleanliness of the restaurant, the service they receieved, and the quality of the food. \n",
    "- There is a research study by Professor Michael Luca and Professor Yejin Choi found that a machine learnt model built using Yelpâ€™s reviews data and past inspection records is able to successfully predict future inspection scores for restaurants 82% of the time. https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/Papers/emnlp13_hygiene.pdf\n",
    "- How does location play a factor in this?\n",
    "    - In some areas, Yelp is not widely used, thus with the limited reviews it does not provide enough information to compare to the health inspection score.\n",
    "    - Also health inspection is not the same in different cities and even states.\n",
    "- There was a study that focused on how much do Yelp scores affect a restaurant.\n",
    "    - https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2011/12/how-much-do-yelp-scores-affect-a-restaurants/\n",
    "    - This study found that: (1) a one-star increase in Yelp rating leads to a 5-9 percent increase in revenue; (2) ratings do not affect restaurants with chain affiliation; (3) chain restaurants have declined in market share as Yelp pentration have increased; (4) consumer response to a restaurant's average rating is affected by the number of reviews and whether the reviewers are certified as \"elite\" by Yelp.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- There is an other study that took NYC restaurant reviews and inspection scores data to find out if there is any correlation between the two. \n",
    "    - https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/nyc-restaurants-reviews-and-inspection-scores/ \n",
    "    - The study found that: \n",
    "        - The study used a scatter plot that shows the relationship between inspection score and rating. It indicated that there is no direct clear correlation between the two variables.\n",
    "        - It is fairly common for a restaurant with a C grade inspection score to acheive a 4-5 star ratings in a review. This could be because as long as the food is tasty, people will rate the restaurant well because they are not and do not pay attention to cleanliness and hygienic issues (what a health inspector pays attention to because it's their job).\n"

    "Each city should have information about their inspections of restaurants and other food establishments.\n",

    "- Inspection scores on y-axis/ Reviews on x-axis\n",

    "I will also do further analysis by reviewing review comments and try to find why some restaurants have good reviews but low inspection score and vice-versa.\n",
