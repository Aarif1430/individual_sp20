The safety health inspection can help to reduce the risk of anything that can  containment with bacteria and toxic chemical, and make food borne illnesses. \n",

Also I believe for checking the restaurant inspection, an unscheduled inspection check can be a great fear for the owner to keep the place safe and healthy. also cleaning tables in restaurants can impact a lot of safety for customers who like to sit and enjoy their meal at the restaurant.
