    "    \"The following presents the outcome of a study designed to assess the impact of increased inspection frequency on compliance measures in Hamilton, Ontario, in the absence of any other changes to food handler/safety programs or legislation...Results indicate that no statistical difference existed in outcome measures based on frequency of inspection.\"\n",

    "    \"Most Campylobacter infections are probably acquired by eating raw or undercooked poultry or eating something that touched it. Campylobacter are also transmitted by other foods, including seafood, meat, and produce; by contact with animals; and by drinking untreated water.\"\n",
    "- 2) Temperature and Campylobcter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter\n",
    "    \"They are positive by the oxidase test and catalase test. Campylobacter spp. are nonfermentative, and are best cultured at 42 °C. Survival at room temperature is poor, but they can survive for a short time at refrigeration temperatures – up to 15 times longer at 2 °C than at 20 °C. The bacterium dies out slowly at freezing temperatures and is heat sensitive: the cells are destroyed at temperatures above 48 °C.\"\n",

It can be problematic because the situations change from year to year. If I cannot get the most recent data, my suggestion for the present or the future might be invalid as the problems may be solved or the situations may be improved. Therefore, I'll keep my confidence level relatively moderate and be conservative if I have to use \"old\" data. "
