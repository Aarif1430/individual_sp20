    "In the review by Jennifer J. Quinlan seen on The Sustainabilist, she states that \"low income populations are more likely to experience greater rates of gastrointestinal illness\". This relates to my research question because by looking at data, you can notice if health inspection scores are lower in low income areas, which could directly correlate to why low income populations have more foodborne illnesses. Knowing this could improve the government's financial support towards low income restaurants that are already less privileged because of their low income.\n",

    "My hypothesis is that there will be health inspector bias with low income restaurant health scores. This is because according to my background sources, the lack of government funding behind low income restaurants can lead to a lack of improved health resources for those restaurants. My hypothesis is also supported through Jennifer Quinlan's review article, where it was found that lower income populations have a higher chance of contracting foodborne illnesses which can correlate to lower health scores in restaurants in those areas."

This would help store variables such as low income neighborhoods, restaurants in those low income neighborhoods, and the health scores of those restaurants in the low income areas. The variables would be names of the low income restaurants. The observations would be the health scores of the low income restaurants. \n"

    "*Fill in your ethics & privacy discussion here*\n",
    "A privacy concern that my question could pose is the exposure of the restaurants with low health scores. This could lead to people avoiding these restaurants because they explicitly see what their health score is. Usually (or at least in my experience), when people show up at restaurants, they're there for the taste of the food, and not the health score, it's not people's main focus. So when a research paper comes out with restaurant's health scores exposed, this would be unethical and lacks privacy for the restaurants. This could also sway restaurants from participating in the study because of the exposure. To solve this problem, I believe anonymity would be the best solution, as this is a focus mainly on health inspector bias than the restaurant itself. Though anonymity may discredit my data a bit, I believe protection in restaurants that are already low income is needed, so that they do not lose the little business they already have. \n",
    "\n",
    "If data was collected, this could be where potential biases can arise. I may miss out on certain low income restaurants in the low income areas, as there are many small businesses that aren't listed online such as Google or Yelp. Though this problem can't be completely solved, I believe maybe asking locals around the area could be a great way to get a feel for the super underground restaurants."
