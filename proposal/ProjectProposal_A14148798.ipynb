    "The United States spends a large amount of money to prevent foodborne illness outbreaks. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \"each year, approximately 48 million people get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of foodborne diseases \" (\"Burden of Foodborne Illness: Findings,\" 2018). Food safety inspections are administered by government or local agents to prevent restaurant-associated foodborne outbreaks and ensure that food is prepared and handled safely. Inspectors use an ABC grading scheme to classify restaurants based on risk. Restaurant owners are mandated to display their letter scores to ensure consumers are informed of the safety of food provided in restaurants. Such efforts have shown to increase the compliance of restaurants with the government's regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, a study conducted in Philadelphia found that \"changes in the targeting and scheduling of food safety inspections could improve the efficiency of detecting violations\" (Leinwand, S. E., Glanz, K., Keenan, B. T., & Branas, C. C. (2017). Importantly, researchers also discovered chain restaurants have fewer violations than non-chain restaurants. We know that a variety of factors influence restaurant inspections' efficacy and reliability in preventing foodborne disease. Therefore, the study aims to determine when should inspections take place to reduce food safety risks in Los Angeles county and how scheduling affects the worker's behavior and the number of violations found? For instance, a study in Tennessee by Jones et al., on restaurant inspection scores and foodborne disease found that \"routine restaurant inspection scores varied substantially over time, by region, and by person performing the inspection\" (2004). \n",

Observations will include date and time of inspection, restaurants' names, violation code, grade, and inspectors' names and the number of inspections done.The table should be ordered logically, from ascending to descending, and with informative labels, to make it easier to read.  I will employ appropriate visualization to show the relationship between the number of violations found and the time the inspections. \n",
