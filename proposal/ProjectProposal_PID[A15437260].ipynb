    "\"The exact proportion of restaurant-attributable foodborne illness is unknown, but national surveillance in the United States found that two thirds of reported foodborne outbreaks from 1998 through 2008 occurred in the restaurant or deli setting, and consumption of food prepared outside the home has been linked to an increased risk of sporadic foodborne diseases.\" Therefore, it is important to accurately measure a restaurant's food safety in the process of health inspection. This research aims to find how accurate current health inspection measures the food safety of restaurant, to The level of food safety will be measured by the number of food illness per month. \n",
