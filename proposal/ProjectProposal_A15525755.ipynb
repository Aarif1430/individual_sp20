    "### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a relationship between a restaurant’s food inspection scores and the average amount of wealth of the neighborhood in Chicago?\n",

    "### Background and Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as I found out we would be doing a project around restaurant health inspection, I knew I wanted to investigate Chicago. This is primarily because it is the third most populated city in America, and I knew there were already many articles on New York and Los Angeles’ restaurant health inspections. I began to conduct research, and I found that Chicago is also the third dirtiest city in America, behind LA and New York(ApartmentTherapy). Because of this, I knew Chicago would be an interesting city to investigate. \n",
    "   \n",
    "After some research I soon found out that the city was having issues with restaurants keeping their facilities clean and up to date. I found an article that specifically discusses how the restaurant review app, Yelp, will flag Chicago restaurants that have the lowest inspection scores in the city. Yelp does this by providing a popup about the restaurants that features the score and why there were docked points (eg: improper thawing, dirty bathrooms, etc etc). I thought this would be interesting, in relation to my research question, specifically because it could have a detrimental impact on these restaurants. If a restaurant with less money or finances is having trouble keeping up with sanitary standards, how is a Yelp popup going to affect their business (ChicagoTribune)? Another article I found stated “the city's health department only inspected 43.9 percent of high-risk establishments, like restaurants, the required minimum of two times in 2015 (NBCChicago).” This stat really made me interested in investigating the city.\n",

    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "I hypothesize that there will be a direct correlation between the health inspection scores and the amount of wealth in the restaurant’s community. I believe it will be a consistent relationship across the board, with the restaurant’s based in the wealthiest communities having the best inspection scores. I believe this because wealthier communities usually indicates better services, which indicates a higher health inspection score.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the variables that would be most important would be the amount of money in the community, a list of the sub-communities in Chicago, specific health inspection notes/violations, addresses of restaurants, type of restaurants, and the health inspection score. This is primarily so I can get an accurate representation of the general workings of the restaurants. I would primarily collect this data through links to the City of Chicago posts on their government website. I’d primarily be observing health inspection scores in restaurants in communities with a wide range of income.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "Thankfully, the city of Chicago posts all of the health inspection data online, so I have access to information that hasn’t invaded anyone’s privacy. There is a “terms of use” page I have to abide by when using this data, but I do not believe it is too restrictive in terms of this project. The only potential bias I see in my dataset would be health inspections not being conducted in wealthier communities, simply because they assume they are maintaining their standard of cleanliness. I plan to combat this by making sure that every establishment I use has the equal amount of health inspections conducted."
