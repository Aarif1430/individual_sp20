    "There is a complete system about grading food health inspection in San Diego. There is a citation from it: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Here's how it works: \n",
    "1. Each violation on the Food Inspection Report is assigned a point value depending on its importance. For example, a Major Risk Factor is worth four points, a Minor Risk Factor is worth two, and a Good Retail Practice is worth one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once the Specialist completes an inspection, the points are added up and subtracted from 100. The resulting number is the inspection \"score\".\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A letter grade is assigned to the facility based on the inspection score. An \"A\" grade means the facility earned a score of 90 to 100 percent and is in satisfactory compliance with state law; a \"B\" means the facility earned a score of 80 to 89 percent and needs improvement; a \"C\" means the facility earned a score of 79 percent or less and is a failing grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The grade card must be displayed near the public entrance during hours of operation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on that information, we need to do research on local restaurants' food source. Once we know where those restaurant get their food souce, we can go to the website and look for the security level of the food.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we need some information about manager's income. I find some data on a employer's wensite, the average Restaurant Manager Salaries in San Diego, CA Area, is 47k/yr with a normal destribution centered on around $51k/yr. If we need certain company/restaurant's manager salary, we can go to the website and search a specific company.\n",
