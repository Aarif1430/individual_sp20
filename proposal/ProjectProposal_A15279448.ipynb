    "In a 2 year study where they explored the outcomes of health inspections in relation to eat-in or take out restaurant inspection frequency and neighborhood sociodemographic, chain restaurants were found to have significantly fewer violations per inspection (1). Chain restaurants serve less perishable food so the chance of foodborne illnesses were less likely. However, it was also noted that the non-chain restaurants that had more violations, also happened to have a higher proportion of residents living in poverty . The takeaway message of this study was that it doesnâ€™t matter if a restaurant is non-chain or chain; health inspections should be done in a way that focuses more on restaurants in areas that seem to be in higher risk.  \n",
