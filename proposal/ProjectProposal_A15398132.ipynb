    "   Health care officials are trying to become more effective and efficient at insepcting restaurants in popoulated cities. In Chicago for example they used other variables to help predict whether a restaurant could possibly earn a critical violation(1). Some of the variables they used for predictions are history of critical violations, sanitation complaints,time since last inspection, and more. It was found that using these other variables as a predictive measure health inspectors could have detected other establshments critical violations a motnh in advance.\n",
    "      \n",
    "   Similarly anothe predictive measure that coud be used is restaurant rating apps. Yelp, for example, in big cities like Los Angles and San Francisco post health sanitation scores on restaurants pages. An article covers how Yelp teamed up with Socrata in order to link the data from restaurant inspection data to Yelp(2). It was foudn that using Yelp data it can predict the chance of health violation at restaurants.\n",

    "I haven't decided who spefically we would collect the data from. We would primariy focus on the reviews of a certain area. Most liekly conducting pilot studies in small areas/cities before expanding to bigger areas."
