    "From the first reference we can see that there's no statistical difference in outcome measures with frequency of inspection in 2008. After 12 years in 2020, it will be interesting to carry out an up-to-date study and parallel them to see if there's change in results throughout the timeline. Moreover, restaurants varies a lot at how they run their businesses, comparing different restaurant types would also help develop specific inspection strategies.\n"
