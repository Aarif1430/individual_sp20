    "In 2014, a consumer report surverying 1003 people about their restaurant complaints. The most common complaints about eating at restaurants people had were hygeine related, such as having \"dirty utensils and tables\", \"dirty or ill-equiped bathrooms\", or having \"servers with sloppy appearance and poor hygiene\". All of these reasons are also health violations according to the California Retail Food Code, for obvious reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Growing up in a low-income urban environment in Oakland, California, a lot of the popular restaurants and eateries amongst the locals do not have questionable and often-times, unsanitary eating areas. Many low income neighborhoods are already food deserts with limited access to healthy food so I was wondering if it is the same case with access to more sanitary eateries.\n",
