    "Why?: Even though the CDC showed conflicting conclusions on whether health inspections at restaurants correlate to decreased likelihood of foodborne illnesses, there haven't been enough studies to show a correlation. I strongly believe that health inspections at restaurants will decrease the likelihood of foodborne illnesses because if a restaurant is unclean and their building is not up to date on regulations, I think that would be an unclean place to manage food, leading to possible contamination of produce."

    "Ideally, my dataset would have the variables of: Inspection date, inspection letter grade, what kind of inspection (regular or surprise), the number of people allowed in the facility, a collection of the number of people who have given complaints of foodborne illness after eating the restaurant's food, violations (if any), number of previous violations in the last 5 years, and what kinds of inspections did the inspector perfom (looking at building, food handling, etc.) Ideally, I would have around 250-300 observations collected from the departments of public health in the city that I'm analyzing, and would be stored in a csv file with the variables as the columns and the observations as the rows."
