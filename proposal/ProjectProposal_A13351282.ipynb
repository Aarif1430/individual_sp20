However, if the data reveals that certain neighborhoods have more health citations than others, and the governement starts targeting those neighborhoods, then there might be an ethical dilemma. This is similiar to racial profiling, the governement would be tartgeting restaraunts based on location. Although this may seem unjust, I think it's alright. The reason for conducting the health inspection is to keep the people of NYC safe. If the government can predict which restaraunts will have violations, then that would help the people of NYC."
