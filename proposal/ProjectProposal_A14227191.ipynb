    " The ideal dataset for this question is to have a collection of data of each type of every tpe of violation. Each violation would list the number of restauraunts that made this violation within the last year while also causing a food-borne illness. Ideally this should include all reported observations of restaurant-caused food-borne illnesses. This data would be collected and posted by the LA Health Department, primarily through self-reporting, as they already have a system setup for this. Ideally this data would be stored in a .csv file for easier data aggregation/calculation. "
