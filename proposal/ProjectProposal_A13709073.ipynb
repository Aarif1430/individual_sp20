    "An ideal dataset to answer this question would be one that includes a resterant's inspection checklist results (food safety items, temperature control items, etc.), their letter grade received for the inspection, and the date the inspection was made. Ideally, we would want around 250 observations from restaurants to sample from the population of a single county (san diego, los angeles, etc.) as we are improving the health inspection process for the city government, not state. These data would ideally be collected from departments of public health and food safety branches holding information of health inspections. These data would, again, be ideally stored in an easy to read table format that has a restaurants placeholder id (to hide identity) and their associating variables across the row."
