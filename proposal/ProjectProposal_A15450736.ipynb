    "Coronavirus statistics are largely public information. Thankfully my data is primarily scientific, as opposed to subjective opinions or another less trustworthy type of data. One downside is that not everything is known about Coronavirus, however we know a lot about how it is spread given its similarity to SARS. One difficult to navigate issue is the high number of asymptomatic carriers scientists have estimated exist. While these cases wouldn't necessarily change my data trends, it will reduce my sample size as there is no way for me to use unreported data. I can simply counteract this by expanding the region of cases that I draw data from, if I should need to."
