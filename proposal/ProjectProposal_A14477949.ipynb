    "Since I was not very familiar with the process of how health insepctions are conducted, I mostly did initial research about how these are done and who they are done by. I found that health insepction regulations are goverened by a state by state basis and can differ slightly based on a county by county basis. The inspections are done by local health departments and are usually done on a scheduled staggered monthly basis (3-months, 6-months, 12-months) depending on the level of risk that the specific establishment has posed in the past (Ref 2,3). Grades usually follow a point system followed by a letter grade system. Resturaunts begin at 100 points and then are deducted based on critical or non-critical violations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are studies in the past specifically talking about bias that health inspectors may have when conducting their inspections. One such study talks about how the schedule that inspectors have may influence their grading throughout the day. It was found that, as the day goes on, found violations tend to lower (Ref 7). This is possibly due to the inspector not wanting to go past their work shift or due to fatigue that builds up along the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another study talked about the \"outcome bias\" inspectors had. When visiting an establishment in which they found multiple violations, it was found that the inspector will increase scruitny for the next establishment citing an increase of found violations. \n",

I believe that if they were to walk out of their car and see an establishment they personally rated low and walk into the establishment right next to it, there would be some adverse effects. "

    "The ideal dataset I would want would be tabular, cleaned data with a significant amount of observations (perhaps a few thousand) with multiple inspectors. The most important variables I should consider are a unique identifier for each inspector, the establishments that they inspected, the location of each establishment (given in latitude and longitude), the rating given to those establishments, and possibly a date for each inspection. National data would be good to consider, but data for a single state would also be good as regulations would be consistent throughout the state. "

Establishments could choose to move around to be nearby other establishments with higher health ratings or move to be away from establishments with lower health ratings. It could possibly also pose some problems with ethnic neighborhoods where resturants of similar culture or cuisines may be relatively close to each other. \n",
