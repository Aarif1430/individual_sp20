    "The relationship between the socioeconomic factors of an area and its general health is one that has been studied often. These studies have shown that socioeconomic status has shown to indirectly damage health through impacting the factors that do directly cause damage to health to the extent of reducing life expectancy by 2.1 years (1). Health inspections are an important process that most businesses must go through to maintain public health. Violations of many kinds are found often, common ones being issues regarding improper food temperatures, employee cleanliness, and pests (2). \n",

    "When accounting for these we follow a path of questioning the relationship between the cleanliness of the businesses in an area and the income levels of the area. Looking at the most common types of violations in an area and how serious they are is an important step in this. This will give us a clearer view to see if there are any certain issues common to a certain area that can be improved on at a systemic level. \n",
