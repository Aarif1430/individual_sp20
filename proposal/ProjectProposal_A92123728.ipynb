    "- 1) My parents owned a restaurant for 20 years that recently closed down. I asked them if they had any complaints about their experiences with the inspectors and they expressed concern with the inconcistency of the inspectors & the lack inspections in general due to budget cuts. They explained that you are assigned a new inspector each year and if that inspector is more strict than others it could result in the restaurant closing down in extreme cases. One bad inspector could end a restaurant since they only rotate once a year and it takes two <70 scres to close a restaurant. When a new inspector was assigned they didn'd know what to expect becuase each inspector seemed to have a different agenda than the last. Consistency seems very important when it could affect how a person/family earns their income so its important that the city ensures their inspectors are all on the same page. Another solution could be to rotate the inspectors more frequently. \n",
    "- 2)https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3323064/ in tennessee the mean inspection of individual inspectors was between 69 and 92. We also see a jump from 69 and 70 indicating that inspectors dont like to give below a 70 to restaurants. \n",
    "- 3) https://www.foodandwine.com/news/restaurant-health-inspections-time-day-study there also has been reporting that time of day has an impact on the score a restauarant recieves. My parents mentioned that some inspectors comes during rush hour which has a much more likely chance of viiolations than on a slower day. \n"

Biases could include if certain inspectors are sent to only certain regions of los angeles with lower/higher average restaurant scores.
