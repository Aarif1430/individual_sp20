    "After conducting some research on health inspections in Los Angeles County (L.A. County), I found that brick and mortar restaurants are inspected 1-3 times a year while food trucks are inspected 1-2 times a year. This could be due the fact that brick and mortar restaurants have a set location while food trucks constantly move around and it would be difficult to track them down. In addition to this, according to public health food safety and regulations in L.A. County, food trucks are held to basically the same standard as brick and mortar restaurants despite the environmental and size differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to an article on Fox News in 2016, about 30% of L.A. food trucks earned a health grade lower than A, while about 18% of brick and mortar restaurants earned a health grade lower than A. It mentioned that “Workers make food in a confined space (“typically less than 8 feet wide by 20 feet long,” according to the paper) and trucks don’t usually have as much equipment as a full size restaurant, which can lead to cross-contamination.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reference that I found online is a case study on food regulations for food trucks in U.S. cities. The case study discusses the varying challenges of facing food safety measures across cities in the U.S., such as Chicago, and New York City. I think this case study will be very relevant for my research question.\n",
