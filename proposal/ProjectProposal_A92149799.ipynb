    "A common myth that has always been circulating around is that Asian restaurants are less hygienic than that of other cuisines. Prior works conducted in 2015 by Andrew Choothakan from USF using the data from the San Francisco Department of Public Health have releaved that indeed Asian restaurants in San Francisco, in general, have lower sanitation score than other cuisines[1]. Since food safety is and should be one of our main concerns when deciding our dining destination, we would like to examine whether a similar pattern applies to restaurants in San Diego nowadays.\n",
    "\n",
    "In San Diego, food safety and restaurant hygiene are monitored by the San Diego Department of Environmental Health (SDDEH), which examines an approximate of 14,000 retail food establishments in San Diego on a rountine basis[2], including unannounced inspections. They use a grading system that penalizes safety violations to ensure compliance to safe food preparation practices. The results of such inspections are publicly accessible under the California Public Records Act, and should play an important role in guiding customer behaviors. We will be mainly using this information to conduct our research.\n",

    "Our hypothesis is that the pattern also applies in San Diego and Asian cuisine restaurants are less hygienic than other cuisines. The reason we thought so is because:\n",
    "1. The food safety regulation, as well as the demographic of San Francisco and San Diego are quite familiar. Therefore, a similar pattern is more likely to appear in San Diego.\n",
    "2. The study conducted by Choothakan is recent enough that makes me believe the improvements (if any) of the food safety practices in Asian restaurants might have not been significant enough.\n"

    "- The data we would like to use to answer this question would ideally have at least 4 variables: __(Restaurant ID, Inspection Time, Inspection Score, Restaurant Cuisine Categorization)__. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In order to have the clearest answer possible, it would be important to have observations from all food establishments (which is approximately 14,000 according to SDDEH). For each restaurant, observation from all previous inspections would be needed. Therefore, the size of the dataset could be in the order of __few hundred thousands observations__, where the unit of observation is the result of one time of inspectation of a restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This data is publicly available and is provided by __SDDEH__ under the California Public Records Act. In addition, restaurant data from __Yelp__ or __Google Places__ might be required to better categorize the cuisine type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- CSV will be the best format to store this kind of tabular data, since each observation is expected to have the 4 variables. We can split the dataset into a table of inspectation occurences __(Restaurant ID, Inspection Time, Inspection Score)__ and a table of restaurant information __(Restaurant ID, Restaurant Cuisine Categorization)__ in order to avoid redundancy in data storage. These two tables can be joined using the restaurant ID."
