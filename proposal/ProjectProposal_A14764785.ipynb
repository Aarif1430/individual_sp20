    "According to sandiegocounty.gov, San Diego County assigns a score out of 100 after performaing an inspection. Violations come in different tiers and are worth different points. If at any time during an inspection a facility is not in compliance with the law, an *Official Notice of Violation* is issued, specifying what is in violation and when it needs to be fixed. \n",
    "There are 3 types of inspection: Routine, Re-inspection, Status Verification. Routine vists are comprehensive and results in scoring the facility. Re-inspections occur when a facility needs to have its compliance verified. Status Verifications are a type of inspection that are used to verify whether a facility is stopp in operation.\n",

    "Harvard Business Review (HBR) embarked on a research project to \"find ways to improve how local government inspectors... [ensure] that restaurants, hospitals, schools, and supermarkets prepare food safely. They go on to say that the transparency of letter grades being posted in facilities helped immensely. HBR disocvered in their research that health inspectors' schedules can affect inspection quality. \"We noticed that inspectors tended to cite fewer violations at each successive establishment they visited through their day,\" demonstrating that inspections are exhausting to conduct. \n",

Check-in and check-out times would have to be documented without the inspector knowing that it was being used for research. Facilities are required to display their letter grade, revealign information about their inspections is public knowledge. They are subject to public scrutiny or boycott if their inspection result is poor. \n",
