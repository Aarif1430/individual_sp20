    "The health issues are always the most signficant and arguable topic in the contemporary world. The government is starting to care about the restaurant health inspection. San Diego is a famous tourism city. Every year, not only local residents but also many travelers visited San Diego and enjoyed delicious food. After knowing the importance of the catering, I decided to research the relationship between the health inspection of restaurants and Yelp information. Since Yelp is the most common application people use to choose the restaurant, under this background, I want to deeply realize the Yelp rating, comment and other information will reveal the health inspection of restaurants. Moreover, recently, yelp provides the health score for each restaurant and I want to figure out whether this information is credible as well. Last but not least, I found some similar prior work about predicting restaurant health inspection Penalty scores from Yelp reviews, which focused on the review text to analyze them to get the relationship with the health inspection. Another research doing the same thing called Yelp versus inspection reports. There is also an article \"Yelp's new health score doesn't mean what you think they do\" to doubt the credibility of Yelp's health score. \n",

    "The ideal dataset I wanted should contain all of the restaurants which have information on Yelp and have health inspection scores in San Diego. Since the number is not so large, or if the collection is still too hard or resources consuming, I will randomly get information from different locations, type(means Chinese,Korean,Seafood restaurants) restaurants. The dataset should contain variables like restaurant information like restaurant name, location, type; Yelp information about this restaurant like ratings, total numbers of reviews, some review examples and other information; health inspection score for each restaurant and the data for given score and maybe the inspector as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains two parts. The first part of the data from Yelp should be collected from the Yelp application. To search online to find the open dataset Yelp provides or to get the information one by one from Yelp after getting their permission. The other part of the data from health inspection of restaurants could be obtained from the website or there are also applications to search for a score of health inspection as well. \n",
