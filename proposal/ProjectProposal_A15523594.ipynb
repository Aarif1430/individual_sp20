    "In researching the public health restaurant inspection system, the baseline frequency I found was that inspections are mandated once every six months at a minimum with additionally inspections being conducted as a result of customer complaints. Looking further into the specific details of health inspections, I found a listing of all the different specific types of inspections. The full list of different types of inspections are: Routine, Follow-Up, HACCP, Complaint, Pre-Operational, License Renewal, and Other inspections (1). The knowledge about the workings of the inspection system could be of great value in interpreting the data collected and determining what pieces of data are the most important. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I researched existing work done surrounding inspections and the data around them. In a public health report published in 2017, there was an investigation conducted to determine the link between \"inspection frequency and restaurant neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics,\" (2). In the report they looked at the restaurant inspections in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from 2013-2014, gathering data about restaurant type (chain or not), number of inspections, and the particular violations in each inspection. They found through their data that chain restaurants had fewer violations in their inspections, however smaller restaurants had a significant decrease in violations with a greater number of inspections. This data is similar to the type of data that I would hopw to work with to answer my question but I would connect it with different pieces of information\n",

    "My hypothesis on the relationship between revenue and the frequency of inspections in restaurants is that restaurants with greater revenue, such as chain locations,  will tend to have fewer inspections. However, I also predict that the places with the smallest sustainable revenues will have fewer inspections than places with a more medium-sized revenue compared to the bigger chains. "

    "The ideal datasets for this project would be one containing data about the inspections conducted on various restaurants in a variety of different areas over two years due to the time between inspections. It would contain variables containing the data about the type of inspection, number of violations, geographic location, and date of inspection. It would also contain data specific to certain inspections such as if it was based on a complaint it would have information about the complaint or if it was a follow-up visit it would have a reference to the first inspection. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other dataset would contain information about the same restaurants as the first dataset but instead containing financial data such as their yearly and monthly profits, as well as containing information about a connection to any other locations and total company revenue (if applicable). It should contain an ID variable as well to be able to link to the data in the other table. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these datasets should have a couple hundred randomly selected restaurants with selections from each different kind of establishment. Also, both should be stored in an easily accessible data file such as a CSV file so it can easily be read for sorting and cleaning."

    "The main privacy concerns that would have to be dealt with in doing this type of data analysis would be the removal of any personally identifiable information that could be tied to individuals in specific restaurant locations. Additionally, it would be important to make sure that the data about revenue and inspections is data that is publicly available for use and would not be violating any privacy laws in using it. A possible bias that could come from the data could be based on the location if a certain area tends to have different characteristics that would be outside the average elsewhere. Another issue that could come up with a certain location being an outlier could be an individual inspection office being too strict or lax in their inspections and possibly skewing that set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to handle these issues would be to be careful inspecting potential datasets to work with and make sure that the data collected was all collected in a way that is legal and ethical, only using figures that come with the entity's consent. In addition, it is also important to look at the locational aspect and ensure that there is enough representation of a variety of different areas to reduce the possible bias that could come from a unique problem in a single area.
