    "This information that I will be looking for is public hence I will have permission to use it since it is our right to know the grade of each restaurant’s food inspection. There are no privacy concerns regarding the datasets since it is public information. The data could have potential biases by the inspectors, as mention in the reference article (3), inspectors can be biased on how many violations they mark in a restaurant and this can affect the dataset. This could be an ethical problem since an inspector can affect a restaurant’s reputation, therefore we expect that each inspector’s review is not biased. For the issue of finding inspector biases what can be done is to assign two inspectors to do the same reviews of restaurants and look at both data sets. This will allow us to see if there are any biases in the process of an inspector. In case we see a discrepancy between two inspectors we can ask a third inspector to review the particular restaurant. This will only be able if the Department of Environmental Health of San Diego works closely with us. But this will help prevent collection bias in our process. "
