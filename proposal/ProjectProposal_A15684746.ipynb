In addition, the question I ask will be not biases for any states, since I am looking for the date overall the United States. And the scope or my inverstigation will be the problem food corresponding to different states.In my opinion, the unintended consequences maybe is the state biase, since different state have different kinds of food problem, so that government will base on the conclusion only force on inspecting those food but omit other food for that particular state. The data is available since I can find data in the government webpage.For the data privacy concerns, it maybe hurt the reputation of the state that the most issues. For those issues that identified, I would like to find the imformation more reliable,find those data more that one website, and try not to find the data that have the biases. For the reputation issue, it will not have the biases result overall the state, I would like to prove that the food is retive to my topic, therefore, I will not open the source for public."
