Some mistakes made prior to health inspections include are improper food storage, incorrect temperature, and contamination due to poor use of kitchen tools(Reference 1) We can see that the health inspection process can improved if we sanitize the kitchen efficiently and maintain the cleanliness.\n",

    "Another research is that health inspectors tend to be more critical of a restaurant who had many unsanitary conditions in the last report (Reference 2). This can be prevented if the restaurant followed the guidelines for a cleaner place.\n",
