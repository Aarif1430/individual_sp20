    "Health Inspections are conducted by local governments in order to assess resturants and ensure safe practices are being executed in order to maintain public health. This can be a difficult process, as many departments have a small number of inspectors and thousands of establishments to carefully assess each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some attempts at establishing a predictive model for high-risk establishment have been made with some success. One model used data from health inspections conducted in New York City from 2011-2014. This model found correlational relationships between the types of violations and probability of future violations, as well as the culture of the establishment (American, Chinese, Italian, etc) bring an important factor in considering risk of future violations (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another model, created for the Chicago health inspection department, built a predictive model to better efficiently assign inspectors to establishments to find violations about 7.5 days faster than without a model. This model relied on several categories, including previous scores and nearby complaints, to assess resturant risks (2).\n",

To protect the privacy of individual establishments, the data provided by this model will not be publicly available, only to the LA County Department of Public Health would this data be released to. As this data was collected by humans during in-person inspections, there is the potential for bias, such as an inspector giving resturaunts owned by one of a certain race lower scores than onwers of another race. As this data will not become publicly available, for use solely by the LA County health inspectors, there is little to no risk for equitable impact or risk of loss of privacy for establishments and their employees/customers. \n",
    "To handle the risk of any privacy violations, only the scores each establishment receives will be available to the health inspectors as well as the corresponding names. This should ensure that only the creators and analyzers of the model and its results know why establishments receive their scores and not release that information to the public, only the letter grade they receive from health inspectors."
