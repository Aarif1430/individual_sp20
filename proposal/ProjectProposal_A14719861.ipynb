    "The process of health inspection is described as â€œOne inspection may not be representative of the overall, long-term sanitation of an establishment. On any given day, a restaurant may have greater or fewer violations than observed during an inspection. In addition, some violations noted on an inspection report may have been corrected at the time of the inspection, which are indicated on the report. Follow-up inspections may be conducted for specific critical violations that cannot be corrected at the time of the inspection.\" (Challenges of Health Department Food Safety Inspections article)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to limited budget, a challenge that the health inspection faced is the fact that there's a lot of restaurant that is only inspected once on quarterly basis, and in some case, once a year. This seems like a bad idea because as stated above, frequent inspection is a way to keep the business uphold their standards (Challenges of Health Department Food Safety Inspections article)\n",

Moreover, I would want the data of food poisoning cases record in each restaurant \n",

The problem already exists, and what I did is trying to find if this problem affect the customers experience at the restaurant in general. The data that I gathered is already available to the publics (Yelp/Google reviews), and the data such as the number of time a restaurant is inspected and total violations per year doesn't seems to touch on any private matter, since it's simply recorded by the health inspection department (which I assume I have access to since I'm in the role of the health inspector).\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't think the data that I planed to collect have any biases since the restaurants is randomly picked, and the inspections already followed the same procedure and standards for every restaurants. One problem that I could faced is obtaining the information of the number of food poisoning case related to each restaurant, since the information may not be reported, and the accuracy of that information maybe questionable. If this to be the case, I will think of other factor that I will use and scrap this data while keeping the core dataset that I mentioned above."
