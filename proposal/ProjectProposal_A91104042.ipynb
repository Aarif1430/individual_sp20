    "Thanks to current situation, health is the number one priority right now. One of the most imporant factor that contributes to personal health is eating better food. However, it is difficult to get variety of food from home cooking. Not every ingredients are available. Therefore, we order food online or go pick up from restaurants. Before, we only focused on food ratings, but now we also need to consider cleanliness of restaurants (Reference #1). When I looked up some restuarnts where I have been dined before, they had records of major and minor violations. Thus, I looked up records for San Diego county. Surprisingly, over 96% of restaurants have grade A (Reference #4). This discrepancy piqued my interest. Because I live near campus, I became curious about other schools'eateries and their inspection ratings (Reference #2 & #3).\n",

    "*The first dataset will be the restaurant inspection data from past 3 years. This set should include name of the restaurant, address, date, result (complete or not), type of inspection (routine or re-check because of violation), violations if any, type of violations (minor, major, out of compliance, or etc.), score, and grade. These observations are from reference link #1. Another data set will contain all of universities and colleges in San Diego country. It will have the name and the address of each school. School data set will be used to merged with restaurant inspection data set. The names will be used as IDs to differenciate observations from other restaurants. Addresses will be used to calculate the distance from schools. Thus, the final set will also have obervations regarding distance.*"
