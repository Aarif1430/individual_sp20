    "There has been research done on race, age, class based disparities in levels of inspections carried out by the EPA, which has led some research to suggest that measures must be taken to improve the equity of the inspection process (1). This research was conducted looking at, in a community, the percentage of African Americans, percentage of Hispanics, low SES index, amongst other variables. Additionally, research has shown that \"Food safety compliance amongst ethnic minority food retail businesses has been identified as being less than satisfactory\", and that \"the research recognizes that language difficulties and lack of knowledge and understanding of the principles of food safety are a major barrier to promoting food safety\" (2).\n",

    "My hypothesis, is that health ratings in communities with higher levels of ethnic diversity will be lower than those with lower levels of ethnic diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that barriers in language, lower levels of food safety education, and challenges related to the equity in which health inspections are carried out result in lower food safety ratings in ethnically diverse communities. Communities with less ethnic diversity (even if the population is largely composed of American racial minorities) will have, in general, higher food safety ratings, since equitable inspections can be carried out more easily amongst a singular target population."

This data can be stored in either tidy format, or in semi-structured formarts like CSV or JSON that can be easily translated into tiny-datasets. This dataset will be based on the amount of communities included in the study and the average size of those communities.\n",

This data can be stored in either tidy format, or in semi-structured formarts like CSV or JSON that can be easily translated into tiny-datasets. In some cases, it may have to be collected through web-scraping. In San Diego, there are 20,000 health inspection records currently, so depending on the number of major cities included in the research, we can imagine the dataset will be a size of some multiple of that.\n",
