There is one possible bias that older people are more likely to have health issues. So I will try to use age over a threshold as a negative term in finding the correlation. If a people has missing disease or frequency of dining out, I will delete the corresponding row because that is the key relationship I am looking for. I think this model might not experience unintended use since it does not provide info about specific population or individuals.*"
