    "For my project, I will determine if there is a relationship between health inspection results and average income of the area around the inspected facility.To accomplish this, I will first clean and sort the data based on Zipcode. Then, I will find the average income level according to Zipcode, and find the average inspection score according to Zipcode. Following that, I will determine if there is a relationship between area income level and inspection score."

    "People always associate hygiene with economy, for example, poor and dirty usually appears together. According to an online source, the food supply in the U.S. is generally considered healthy and safe.However, bacteria and parasites may remain in fresh or processed meat and poultry products, which can cause human illness if the food is improperly prepared or handled. Residues of agricultural chemicals may remain on fruits and vegetables, and prolonged dietary exposure to such chemicals may pose a risk of cancer or other adverse health effects. (1) The cost of doing constant bacterial tests to ensure food safety is a relatively large amount of money(2), so it seems reasonable to interpret and hypothesis that facilities in poor economic areas can not afford to do such tests, which may result in a lower inspection score\n",
