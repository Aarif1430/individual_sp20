    "In North Carolina, restaurants and other food establishments are inspected by local county professionals between one and four times annually$^{1}$. In these inspections, violations are counted and tabulated, each with its own point value depending on its severity; the points are then subtracted from 100 to give a restaurant's final score, which is then used to determine its letter grade$^{1}$. This simple system allows for a straightforward way to quantify the sanitary conditions of restaurants, making it possible to carry out data analyses to investigate general trends and determining factors of said conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, I have decided to investgiate whether the location of a restaurant in North Carolina, and more specifically said location's socio-economic condition, has a considerable impact in said restaurant's sanitary conditions. Certain characteristics about neighborhoods, including how busy it is and the average spending potential of its residents/bypassers, can greatly impact key factors for a restaurant's success, including the amount of customers it can expect to have and the amount of revenue that it can generate. Customer traffic and revenue in turn can affect many factors related to sanitary conditions, including: how much staff a restaurant can hire (and how overworked said staff is), how well trained the staff is, the quality of the equipment, the quality of the produce, how often produce has to be restocked, how  much attention managers can devote to health and safety practices, etc. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the socio-economic conditions of a restaurant's area will somehow affect its health and safety conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most relevant research related to my investigation was a study conducted by the Environmental Health Specialists Network, based on several US states, which aimed to identify which factors most impacted safe food preparation practices in a restaurant. The study concluded that some of the main factors were the time pressure the employees felt, the quality of their equipment, the resources they had available and the emphasis managers gave to food safety$^{2}$. As discussed in the previous paragraph, many of these factors can be impacted by a restaurant's location and its socio-economic conditions, so this study helps corroborate that my research question holds promise and is worth investigating.\n",

   "source": [
    "I expect that there will be a postive relationship between North Carolina restaurants' location and the socio-economic characteristics of said location, and their overall sanitary conditions, with restaurants in wealthier neighborhoods having fewer health/safety violations then restaurants in low-income, emptier neighborhoods. The reason for that premise was hinted at in the previous section: restaurants in wealthier neighborhoods are more likely to have a constant influx of customers with sufficient spending power to drive their business, thus have the ability to have an adaquately-sized staff that is properly trained and equipped to maintain appropriate health conditions. Conversely, restaurants in low-income neighborhoods are more likely to have sufficient customers/revenue to adequately train and equip their staf, and it might face financial hardships that would lead it to overlook sanitary issues.
