    "## OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aim to prove that health inspections can be reorganized to make them more efficient. First point that is considered is the frequency of health inspections carried out each day per health inspector. Optimally a health inspector should carry out one health inspection per day or two at the most if we want their work to be thorough. The second point that is considered is whether health inspections in non-chain restaurants should be carried more frequently than chain restaurants. We will show that the answer to the previous inquiry is affirmative since chain restaurants tend to have far less health violations. "

    "## Background and Prior work\n",
    "\n",
    "Foodborne illnesses are a serious public health concern as it causes millions of illnesses, hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations, as well as thousands of deaths each year [1]. That is precisely why restaurant health inspections are crucial to prevent the spread of foodborne illnesses. Thus, if a health inspection is done right it can prevent restaurants with multiple food violations from serving bad food. Conversely if done improperly it can cause the spread of foodborne illnesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it is important to note that restaurant health inspections are subject to certain unconscious biases. For instance, a study has shown that health inspectors tend to cite fewer violations at each successive establishment they visited through their days [2]. Another study worth mentioning is a study that shows that more frequent health inspections does not necessarily decrease the number of violations in restaurant chain but does decrease the number of violations in nonchain restaurants [1]. \n",

    "## Hypothesis \n",
    "\n",
    "I expect to see that if we limit the number of health inspections to 2 inspection sites per day for each health inspector, as well as order nonchain restaurants to be put as the first inspection during any given day, and make nonchain inspections more frequent than chain inspections then we would see less foodborne illness.

    "## Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable: restaurant id or HSISID, number of inspection per restaurants in a given year, number of violations per inspection, score given to the restaurant after inspection, number of inspection per day per inspector, whether a restaurant is a chain restaurant or nonchain restaurant, zipcode, as well as the median household income in that zipcode. \n",
    "\n",
    "HSISID, number of violations, and whether the restaurant is a chain or nonchain restaurant would be collected from the relevant websites where the health inspection is published (usually publically published). However in this case the data files are provided to us. Restaurants.csv can tell us the facilytype, restaurant ID or HSISID. Inspections.csv can give us the inspection score, zipcode, date, as well as who inspected it. Zipcode.csv can give us the median household income associated to every zipcode. Finally violations.csv can give us information on the number of violations per inspection. \n",
    "\n",
    "This data will be collected within a given state, in this case North Carolina. For the purpose of this analysis one State is enough but the data should not be collected in only one city of the State. Therefore data from multiple cities should be collected. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data should also be collected over the period of 4 years. Since health inspections do not occur often in a year, we need to accumulate 4 years worth of data to have enough data to make a proper analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "After datacollection is complete; to put all this data in a usable form, we can just import the relevant csv files, take the relevant columns from each dataframes and merge them together to get a dataframe with 8 features. \n",
