    "For my final project, I investigated a potential relationship between a restaurant's price designation on Yelp and their proportion of foodborne illness related violations. To do this, I calculated distributions of the aforementioned proportions along lines of price designation, and performed a t-test. After a t-test, I was able to conclude that no such relationship exists, within the context of provided datasets."

    "Due to the COVID-19 pandemic plaguing the world at large, now, more than ever, consumers are skeptical about the hygenic practices of the restaurants they frequent. In 2014, a report from the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) concluded that the average consumer is twice as likely to contract a foodborne illness eating at a restaurant than they are cooking their own food at home. However, this study failed to specify whether a consumer was more likely to contract food poisoning at certain restaurants, than they are at others. Along lines of restaurant pricing, the average consumer would likely assume that they are more likely to contract food poisoning eating at a fast-food restaurant, than they would be eating at a gourmet bistro. This conclusion is driven by perceptions of fast-food cleanliness, which have been reinforced by events such as the Chipotle E-Coli outbreak that infected thousands with food poisoning. (1,2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on current research, these perceptions of fast-food cleanliness are largely incorrect. In another study performed by the CPSI, they determined that there was not a significant difference in health department inspection scores along lines of pricing. However, it is important to note that not all inspection scores are created equal, within the context of food poisoning. In North Carolina, which is the population of this project's dataset, there are eight different violation categories described in the 2009 Food Code. Only one of these categories covers the transmission of foodborne illness. So despite restaurants of all price ranges recieving similar total scores on average, it is entirely possible that restaurants of a particular price range may recieve more food-poisoning related violations than others. This research question of this project aims to explore this possibility. (1,3)\n",

    "*In North Carolina, there does exist a positive relationship between a restaurant's price designation, and that restaurants proportion of foodborne illness related violations. That is to say, that more expensive restaurants have higher proportions of food-poisoning related violations than less-expensive restaurants. I believe this to be the case because more expensive restaurants are less likely to use frozen or pre-made foodstuffs than lower priced restaurants. This means they handle raw foods more frequently, which increases the chances of contamination within the kitchen.*"

    "##### Data Cleaning Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How 'clean' is the data?\n",
    "- The Data was very clean for the most part. There were quite a few observations with NAN values, but those weren't very hard to deal with. The biggest issue I encountered was the presence of random garbage values in the Yelp dataset, specifically the price column. However, since price values are a predefined set, it wasn't very difficult to detect garbage and remove those observations. Another issue I faced was inconsistency in address typing. Addresses in one dataset would be all caps, and lowercase in another. This prevented me from joining tables on addresses, intitally, since python string comparisons are case sensitive. To remedy this, I made all addresses lowercased.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What did you have to do to get the data into a usable format? (If you did nothing, how did you determine there was nothing to do?)\n",
    "- Since the data I needed was scattered across multiple tables, I had to drop redundant columns and perform appropriate inner joins between datasets. This allowed me to get the relevant information (restaurant pricing, id, and violation codes) consolidated into one dataset. As mentioned previously, joining the tables on addresses wasnt possible initially due to case senstivity and input inconsistency, so this required processing each address into lowercase before joining the tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### What pre-processing steps that were required for your methods (for example, checking data distributions and performing any transformations that may be required)\n",
    "\n",
    "- One pre-processing step that was required was to check the unique values of price in the Yelp dataset. This is what alerted me to the existence of garbage values in the dataset. I ended up dropping all rows from the dataset that didn't have a valid value. After that happened, I also checked the unique values of violationcodes; thankfully everything checked out. This type of processing wasn't necessary for addresses and ids, since garbage values would be discarded naturally when an inner join was performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another step of pre-processing that was required, as mentioned previously, was that I had to change all address strings to lowercase, so that I could join tables without having to worry about case sensitive comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I also had to replace all dollar signs with descriptive strings for the price column, since matplotlib runs into issues when parsing dollar signs (something to do with LaTeX).\n"

Other distributions to note are the null distribution of proportions of foodborne illness, depicted above, and the distributions by pricing category, which were statistically proven to originate from this null distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Are there any outliers?\n",
    "- The amount of Tier 4 restaurants relative to the other tiers can be considered an outlier, since the difference is so large. Also, when looking at the null distribution of proportions of foodborne illness, there are a couple outliers in the 1.0 bin. This isn't significant, but fun to note - there exists restaurants that have ONLY had violations related to foodborne illness... yikes!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Relationship between variables?\n",
    "- A trivial relationship between variables is that each hsisid has only one pricing category across all observations. Other than that, thanks to the results of the t-test, I was unable to prove any other relationships between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Analysis:\n",
    "###### What approaches did you use? Why?\n",
    "- Half way through the analysis, I discovered that the proportions of foodborne illness related violations were not even across pricing categories, and that more expensive restaurants (tier 4) had a higher proportion. However, in order to check that these results were statistically significant, I used a t-test to check if the differences in proportion were due to chance, and that they all originated from the same sample distribution.\n",
    "###### What were the results?\n",
    "- As concluded by the p-values above, I determined that the differences of the categories' proportion distributions were due to chance, and were not statistically significant.\n",
    "###### What were your interpretation of these findings.\n",
    "- I think that it is important to note that the p-values for Tier 2 and Tier 4 restaurants were VERY small (~.03). By other measures of statistical significance (p > .05), we could have concluded that there was a statistical difference in proportions of foodborne illness across pricing categories. However, due to limitations of the dataset (connecting Yelp addresses to hsisid's resulted in loss of thousands of rows bc of the limitations of the Yelp set), it is better to assume NO statistical difference in proportion."

    "The datasets used in this project were provided to me by COGS 108 teaching staff, with implicit permission to use the data for this purpose. In regards to privacy, I took care to remove potentially identifiable information such as restaurant addresses, even though these are public records. It is important to note that the population of North Carolina, racially, monetarily, or even food-preference wise,  is not representative of the population of California, nor the United States as a whole. A study on the proportion of foodborne illness violations across pricing categories done nation-wide may yield entirely different results, due to factors like food preference (maybe theres more foodborne illness violations in Alaska due to seafood diet?) and living conditions ( distributions of restaurants across pricing categories may be different in California, due to higher prices). It is also important to note that inspection data may reflect innate human biases, and that a human inspector may be stricter/lenient on particular restaurants, along lines of price, or other unseen factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I wasnt able to prove a statistical difference in proportion of foodborne illness violation along lines of restaurant pricing, I do think its important to consider that the results of this analysis may be used to label more expensive restaurants as unclean, since even equal proportions across pricing tiers challenges the typical belief that less expensive restaurants are less hygenic, and would have more foodborne illness violations than more expensive counterparts. To this, I remind readers of the limitations of this report (mainly the dataset location, and shortcomings of the Yelp set), and that results in this specific sample from North Carolina are not proven to extrapolate to your location. I urge readers not to make conclusions until more comprehensive research has been done."

    "The question this report sought to answer was the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "*In North Carolina, is there a relationship between a restaurant's price designation on Yelp, and proportion of foodborne illness related violations?*\n",
    "\n",
    "I predicted that there would be a relationship, and that more expensive restaurants would have a higher proportion of foodborne related violations, since they are more likely to be working with raw food.\n",
    "\n",
    "To research this question, using the given datasets, I assigned restaurant price ranges from Yelp to observations in the violations dataset. I was able to do this across datasets by first joining on addresses, then by joining on hsisid. The result was a dataset tailored to this research question, with observations consisting of ['hsisid','violationcode', 'price']. Initally, the proportions calculated along lines of price were very different, with the most expensive restaurants having the highest proportion! However, a subsequent t-test on the distributions concluded that these findings were due to chance, and were not statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the results of my data analysis, I have decided to reject my hypothesis. That is to say, that in North Carolina there does not exist a positive relationship between a restaurants price designation, and the proportion of foodborne related violations. In fact, the results of my analysis infer that the proportion of foodborne related violations, across all price ranges, originate from the same null distribution. That is to say, that the proportion of foodborne illness related violations does not differ, in a statistically significant manner, across pricing categories. Therfore, the answer to my research question, is: \n",
    "\n",
    "*In North Carolina, there does not exist a relationship between a restaurant's price designation on Yelp, and proportion of food-poisoning related violations*\n",
    "\n",
    "Before concluding, it is important to discuss some of the limitations of this report. First and foremost, the provide datasets were not comprehensive by any means. Even though my research question was narrowed down to North Carolina, it is important to note that the datasets werent a comprehensive representation of North Carolina (notably missing observations from Charlotte, NC's biggest city). So the findings of this report cannot be extrapolated to North Carolina, or the USA as a whole, due to these shortcomings. The results exist as they pertain to this provided dataset, thats all. Because of this, I encourage readers not to make conclusions based off this report, and to instead wait for more comprehensive research to be performed. I do think this topic is deserving of more comprehensive research, especially since some of the p-values were so low!"
