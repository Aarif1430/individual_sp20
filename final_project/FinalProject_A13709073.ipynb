In an effort fo find out why, I looked to the health inspection regulations and checklists and began thinking of how these items could affect the overall grade for the resteraunt. Knowing the answer to this could give an opportunity to spread information to other restaurants and increase health and safety regulations while also improving restaurant health inspection processes."
