    "Growing up, my family moved around a lot. We have lived in both small towns and large metropolitan cities throughout Southern California. Regardless of where our home is, we were always on the lookout for our next favorite seafood restaurant. From experience, I found that areas with a dense population of people tended to have restaurants that serve fresher seafood. This holds true even within the same city or county. When looking for good, safe seafood to eat, I always look for restaurants located in areas where most people live. I usually avoid restaurants that are in quiet, out-of-the-way locations with less people. I am suspisious of those establishments, and do not want to risk my safety by consuming ill-prepared seafood.\n",
    "\n",
    "I held these beleifs for years. Everything changed, however, after a breif conversation with my sister. She beleives the exact opposite. She prefers seafood establishments located in low-density populations. She feels that the best seafood comes from places with less foot traffic and less patrons. You see, my sister worked as a waitress in a small-town sushi restaurant for two years. Her experience lends weight to her opinion, but I am not ready to give up yet. I decided to dedicate this project to discovering which of us is correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will analyse each health inspection's overall score and the population density of the zip code in which it resides."

    "Foodservice establishments are inspected by environmental health specialists in order to make sure the food served there is safe for public consumption. This prevents food-borne illnesses from ravaging communities. Depending on its conditions, the inspector gives the establishment a score ranging from 70 - 100. Each violation of heath safety code is given a point value of 1 or 2. These violations are then added up and subtracted from 100. An 'A' rating is a score from 90 - 100, 'B' : 80-89.5, and finally 'C' : 70 - 79.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to being assigned a point value, each violation is also assigned a code. This code indicates the nature of the violation. They can be food related such as temperature control, labeling, contamination, improper sources, or improper cooking, etc. Or they can be related to other categories such as poor management and training, chemical risks, equipment, etc. If not careful, the restaurants can lose points due to any one of these factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "By law, food establishments must display their food score rating. This information is also availible through online government or state websites. This project utilizes health score information to complie the data and locate the businesses on a map. Through web scraping, lists of zip codes and the number of people living in that zip code was compiled. Data from Yelp, an online platform that allows business and customers to interact, is also used.\n",

    "I hypothesize that there is a relationship between population size and health inspection score. I predict that as population in a given area increases, the health inspection score will also increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "    My reasoning for this is the following: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The state or county authorities deploy more frequesnt health inspections to restaurants in heavily dense areas compared to sparse areas because of the higher risk to public safety. So a restaurant in downtown LA will receive more yearly inspections than one in Elysian Park, for example. Therefore, these establishments will have more experience and motivation to remain clean and avoid violations. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Also, when a population in a given area is large, restaurants in those areas will naturally have more foot traffic and more patrons eating there. A busy establishment means that food must be bought on a regular basis since it is being consumed quickly, therefore the food will be more fresh and pose less of a safety risk to people."
